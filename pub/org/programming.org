* Python
I am an avid user of the [[https://www.python.org/][Python]] programming language, which is modern, powerful,
elegant, open-source, and well-documented.  I use the [[http://ipython.org/][IPython]] environment and
rely on the [[http://xarray.pydata.org][xarray]], [[http://www.numpy.org/][NumPy]], [[http://scipy.org/][SciPy]], and [[http://matplotlib.org/][matplotlib]] modules to analyze climate
model data via the free [[https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/][Anaconda]] distribution.
** pangeo-data project
There is a growing discrepancy between the scale of data that is generated by
climate models and observational products and the capability of tools commonly
used by scientists to analyze that data.  Fortunately, the [[http://dask.pydata.org/en/latest/][dask]] Python package
enables parallel computations on a single node and works with ~xarray~ largely
with little effort by the user.  For multi-node computing environments,
[[https://distributed.readthedocs.io/en/latest/][dask.distributed]] provides the same functionality across nodes, and it is
actively being developed to work with data represented via ~xarray~ to provide
similarly user-friendly computations on climate data that is parallelized across
multiple nodes.

[[https://www.github.com/pangeo-data][pangeo-data]] is an organization of climate scientists and computer scientists
that seeks to build tools useful to climate data analysis and that harness the
power of xarray + dask + dask.distributed.  We are actively seeking new users
and contributions; please see the Github page linked above for more information.
** Python packages I have created
*** =aospy=
My colleagues and I often lament how much time we spend messing with computer
code in order to output data or figures.  Also, lacking sufficient metadata to
describe what they actually do/are, scripts/plots quickly become outdated and
untrustworthy (e. g. "Did I remember to change the output variable in the script
when I made this plot?").  In addition, creating plots one by one can be
impractical when dozens of plots are needed (e.g. DJF, JJA, SON, MAM, and annual
mean plots of multiple variables from multiple experimental runs and/or multiple
models and/or multiple ensemble members).

This frustrating inefficiency has led me to create a Python module that automates
these tasks. Dubbed "aospy", it's aim is to, given some dataset, perform all
frequently used calculations, create plots, and store all results and metadata
conveniently.  And do this all with minimal input by the user.

The source code for aospy is available on [[https://github.com/spencerahill][my Github]].  However, it is quite a
mess in its current state and very poorly documented.  I am working with Spencer
Clark of Princeton AOS to clean it up and create a proper v0.1 release
(someday...).

* Emacs & Org-Mode
** Overview
[[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs.html][Emacs]] is a powerful text editor that I use for as many tasks as I can.  [[http://orgmode.org/][Org-mode]]
is an extension of Emacs for creating outline-like documents, with many powerful
tools for embedding to-do lists, links, code, and images and for converting the
files to LaTeX, HTML, and other formats.

This integration of elements typically found in scientific manuscripts makes
Org-mode a potentially useful vehicle for [[http://reproducibleresearch.net/][reproducible research]] -- try Googling
"org mode reproducible research" or checkout this [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-dUkyn_fZA&list=FLQp2VLAOlvq142YN3JO3y8w][YouTube video]] by John Kitchin,
a chemical engineering professor at Carnegie Mellon.  He also has a nice [[http://kitchingroup.cheme.cmu.edu/blog/2014/08/08/What-we-are-using-org-mode-for/][page]]
highlighting the powers of Org-mode in reproducible research and beyond.

In fact, my website and CV are written entirely as org-mode files, which I then
publish to HTML (and PDF for the CV) using Org-Mode's Publish functionality.
See the link at the bottom of this and other pages on my site for the raw
org-mode files that I use to generate the HTML.  I also intend to publish these
source files on Github eventually as an example of how Org-mode can be used.
