I live in New York City with my wife, Alyssa, and our dog, Dempsey.  I
commute to Princeton via subway/train/bike/shuttle 2-3 days per week and
otherwise work from home.

When not doing science, I love exploring the city with Alyssa and Dempsey:
trying new restaurants and coffee shops, running along the Hudson river, going
to the dog park, seeing movies, DIY fix-ups to our (small) apartment, and just
relaxing at home together.  I'm also an avid music fan/critic and book reader.
